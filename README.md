Question 2:
This project demonstrates two fundamental operations in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Edge Detection Using Sobel Filters (OpenCV & NumPy)
Applies Sobel filters (Sobel-X and Sobel-Y) to detect edges in a grayscale image.
Uses a built-in sample image from scikit-image (no external file required).
Displays the original image alongside the edge-detected results.
Max Pooling & Average Pooling (TensorFlow/Keras)
Generates a random 4×4 matrix as input.
Applies 2×2 Max Pooling and 2×2 Average Pooling with a stride of 2.
Prints the original matrix, max-pooled output, and average-pooled output.
Key Concepts Demonstrated:
✔ Sobel Filtering (Horizontal & Vertical Edge Detection)
✔ Convolution Operations
✔ Pooling Layers (Dimensionality Reduction)
✔ TensorFlow/Keras for Deep Learning Operations
